FEEDBACK
What is the intent of the Skills section?
For example, the To Do list Skills section includes
  - can use fetch API to make HTTP requests
  - can use ES6 and use babel-node
  - can build a RESTful API using express
  But these aren't necessarily specified in specs -- babel & ES6 are in Stretch....
  (similar issues in Skills v. Specs in previous modules)
  - Can describe the general programming term SOLID
    But there's no recommended reference/video for this lengthy and somewhat esoteric group of principles (e.g. L for Liskov Substitution Principle; D for Dependency Inversion Principle), or at least unhelpfully named principles that negate the helpfulness of having a mnemonic device (SOLID) for a group of principles.
    - I googled & found the original 16-page article written in 2000 that introduced the principles using C++ examples...
    - A beginner article seems more appropriate (https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)
      - but it's not vetted by LG
    Is there a lecture on it?  The module should link to it.
      - Perhaps link to channel, and Learners should use thumbs up/down & comments to help future learners choose the appropriate video for their needs



Can use ES6 and use babel-node to transpile the code
